## Day

**Time:** [07:30]
**Activity:** Amelia wakes up with little Maya, her 4-year-old daughter, by her side. She gently kisses Maya's forehead before getting out of bed for a cup of coffee brewed on the stovetop while Maya plays with her stuffed animal near the window.

**Time:** [08:15]
**Activity:** Amelia helps Maya get ready for daycare - brushing her hair and dressing her in a bright purple dress. As she dresses, she starts humming along to her favorite singer's song, "La Vida Es Un Carnaval" while making coffee stronger for herself.

**Time:** [08:45]
**Activity:** The commute begins!  Amelia drops Maya off at daycare and finds solace in the quiet ride on the metro towards work.

**Time:** [09:30] 
**Activity:** Amelia arrives at her studio apartment, taking out her laptop and settling into the cozy living room where natural light bathes her workspace.

**Time:** [10:00]
**Activity:** Emails start pouring in - deadlines for a school project, revisions on a brochure, and an upcoming exhibition she's participating in. She makes herself coffee again as Maya’s voice calls out, “Mama!” from the nearby playground area

**Time:** [11:30] 
**Activity:**  Amelia takes a quick break to walk with Maya through their small neighborhood park, breathing in the fresh morning air. They enjoy watching other children chase pigeons and laugh on the swings.

**Time:** [12:45] 
**Activity:** Amelia dives back into her work after a brief lunch break. A surge of inspiration hits while she’s sketching a logo for a local café.  She spends another hour crafting and editing Maya's drawings into a charming postcard, sending it to her family in Mexico.

**Time:** [14:00]
**Activity:** Amelia finds solace in the tranquility of art – sketching different concepts for a mural design while enjoying her afternoon coffee. The cafe’s aroma fills her studio as she continues, inspired by Maya's colorful drawings scattered around the room. 

 **Time:** [15:30]  
**Activity:** Lunch break. Amelia eats a sandwich at her desk with fresh bread from the market and makes sure to take a few minutes for a walk through the park before returning to work.

**Time:** [16:00]
**Activity:** Maya’s energy fills the studio again, begging for a quick game of "hide and seek" in her favorite corner. As she plays with her imaginary friends, Amelia finishes up some final edits before calling it a day at 17:00

 **Time:** [17:00]
**Activity:**  Amelia heads home from work - leaving behind the familiar comfort of her art studio. A gentle evening breeze carries the scent of fresh bread and jasmine as she picks Maya up after school. The two share a quiet moment by the window, watching the setting sun paint the sky in hues of orange and pink

 **Time:** [18:00]
**Activity:** Amelia cooks dinner - a simple pasta with vegetables that both they enjoy - before reading her daughter a story about a brave little explorer from the library's book collection.

**Time:** [19:30]
**Activity:**  After Maya goes to bed, Amelia enjoys a cup of chamomile tea as she looks through pictures of Maya’s drawings and projects. She finds inspiration in every stroke and detail – a quiet moment of pure joy before drifting off to sleep around midnight.
