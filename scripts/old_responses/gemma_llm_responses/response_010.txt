**Time:** 08:00
**Activity:**  Maya heads to the rooftop space at the cafe where she finds inspiration. The city is awash in a kaleidoscope of colors -  the vibrant hues of traditional clothes, the bustle of auto-rickshaws, the early morning light on the Bombay skyline – and it feeds her creativity. She clicks photos of street vendors selling spices and flowers, a group of men playing Kabbadi on the street.

**Time:** 10:30

**Time:** 20:00
**Activity:** Maya gets back to her apartment, settling down on her balcony with a cup of masala tea and a slice of mango cake.
