**Time: 13:00**
**Activity:**  Lunchtime brings an escape to a bustling corner pub near the studio. The aroma of freshly baked bread hits his senses, followed by Liam’s usual burger with a side of sweet potato fries. A pint of local ale adds a touch of British character to the afternoon.

**Activity:**  A leisurely stroll through Regent's Park offers a peaceful escape. Liam watches children play amidst vibrant greenscapes, while the city lights begin to shimmer in the evening sky. As he sits under the ancient oaks, he allows his mind to wander free, dreaming of his next project.

**Time: 20:30**
**Activity:**  After another cuppa and a slice of lemon cake, Liam switches off the laptop and dives into a book about art movements in London's past - an escape into history amidst the ever-changing present.

**Time: 22:30**
**Activity:**  With his day complete, Liam snuggles into bed under his worn woolen blanket. The comforting hum of the street far away is a lullaby he can easily fall asleep to, leaving him dreaming about vibrant colours and stories told through art.
