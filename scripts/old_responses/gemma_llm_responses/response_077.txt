**Day:** 

* **06:30**: Wake up, stretching gently while enjoying the morning sunlight streaming through the large window of her apartment overlooking the bustling Rambla.
* **06:45**: Make a quick breakfast of a fresh orange juice and toast with homemade almond butter. The aroma of warm bread always reminds Elena of her grandmother's kitchen.

* **11:30**: Head home and indulge in a leisurely lunch of fresh gazpacho and crusty bread. Elena often cooks at home, allowing her creative juices to flow while preparing the meal.  
* **12:00**: Dive into emails about her upcoming exhibition. She responds to press inquiries, arranges transport for delivery of final pieces, and makes a list for potential sponsorships.
* **14:00**: Take a break from the screen and head to the park's tranquil rose garden.  She sits with a cup of herbal tea, watching a butterfly land on a petal and enjoying the calming atmosphere. 
* **15:00**: Head back to her studio and dive into her latest project – a ceramic portrait of the city's historic architecture in miniature.  The intricate details are a challenge that fuels her creative fire and keeps her engaged. 
* **18:30**:  Dinner! Elena cooks her husband’s favourite paella, which always evokes memories of her grandmother in a sunny Catalan farmhouse kitchen. Laughter and stories shared over the delicious meal are a treasured part of their evening routine.
* **20:00**: Enjoy an evening walk along the Barceloneta Beach as the sun dips below the horizon, leaving behind a blanket of sparkling stars on the water. The cool sea breeze washes away any stress and leaves her feeling refreshed and ready for sleep. 
* **21:00**:  Settle down with a good book to unwind before the day ends.  Elena enjoys reading historical novels that transport her through time and space. 
* **22:30**: Lights out. The calming sounds of Barcelona's night come alive in the quiet stillness of her bedroom.
