**Time: 07:00**
Activity: Slowly, Ava gets out of bed and stretches, remembering to breathe deeply as she moves.  She makes a cup of chai with turmeric and ginger before grabbing her phone. She checks for emails from clients about the new wedding photography project - it's exciting! 

**Time: 08:00**

**Time: 10:00**
Activity: Ava heads to her studio - a converted apartment with sunlight streaming through large windows.

A sense of purpose washes over her, fueling her energy as the day continues.
