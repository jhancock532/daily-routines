Maya Singh, 28
Female
India (Mumbai)
Backstory: Maya is a freelance graphic designer who moved to Mumbai from her hometown in Delhi three years ago to pursue her passion for art. She lives alone in a small apartment and spends most of her free time exploring the city's street food scene.

Day:

Time: 06:00
Activity: Woke up to the sound of her phone alarm, which she had set for an hour earlier than usual today because she has a meeting with a potential client later this morning.

Time: 06:15
Activity: Brushed her teeth and splashed some water on her face to wake herself up. She stumbled over to her kitchenette to make a cup of strong black coffee, which was the only thing that could get her going in the mornings.

Time: 07:00
Activity: Grabbed her phone and scrolled through social media while eating a quick breakfast of toast and scrambled eggs. She saw some inspiring art work from one of her friends and spent the next 20 minutes admiring it and reading the artist's comments on the process behind the piece.

Time: 08:00
Activity: Got dressed in comfortable clothes, which consisted of a pair of faded jeans and a bright yellow top that made her feel happy. She then quickly ran through her schedule for the day, making sure she had all the necessary materials ready for her meeting with the potential client.

Time: 09:15
Activity: Left her apartment building and walked down to the street to hail an auto-rickshaw, which would take her to the meeting venue. The morning traffic was bad today, but Maya was prepared and listened to some upbeat music on her phone while waiting for the rickshaw to arrive.

Time: 10:15
Activity: Arrived at the meeting venue, which was a trendy coffee shop in the Bandra area of Mumbai. She met with the client, whose name was Rohan, and discussed his project requirements for designing some brand-new logos for his start-up company.

Time: 12:00
Activity: Had lunch with Rohan at a nearby restaurant while they continued to discuss details about the project. They ordered some delicious street food-style momos and sat down in the cozy outdoor seating area of the restaurant, where Maya felt relaxed and could focus on the meeting without any distractions.

Time: 13:30
Activity: Went back to her apartment to grab a quick nap before heading out to meet up with friends for dinner. She spent the next hour resting on her couch and watching an episode of her favorite TV show while trying to recharge her batteries after the morning's meetings.

Time: 16:00
Activity: Got ready to meet her friends, which included a group of four close friends from college who lived in different parts of Mumbai but would often get together for dinner. Maya met up with them at a popular restaurant called The Tandoor in Khar and spent the next few hours laughing, sharing stories, and catching up on each other's lives.

Time: 19:30
Activity: Said goodbye to her friends after a fun-filled evening of good food, great company, and hilarious conversations. Maya headed back home, feeling grateful for the wonderful friendships she had made in this city and looking forward to another exciting day ahead.

Time: 21:00
Activity: Wound down from the evening's activities by spending some quiet time alone at home, watching a funny YouTube video on her phone while snacking on some popcorn. She then decided it was time for bed, knowing that she had an early start tomorrow morning for another meeting with potential clients.

Time: 22:00
Activity: Got into bed and drifted off to sleep, feeling content and ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in the next day.
