Let's create a person with the following details:

**Name:** Emily Wilson
**Gender:** Female
**Age:** 29
**Location:** Australia (specifically, Sydney, New South Wales)
**Backstory:** Emily grew up in a small town in rural NSW, moved to Sydney for university and has been working as a graphic designer ever since. She loves the city but often feels overwhelmed by its fast pace.
