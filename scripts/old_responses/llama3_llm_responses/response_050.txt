And here's a random day from her life:

Time: 06:00
Activity: Woke up to the sound of birds chirping outside her window, feeling refreshed after a good night's sleep.

Time: 06:30
Activity: Brushed her teeth and got dressed in the cozy bedroom she shares with her cat, Luna.

Time: 07:00
Activity: Headed downstairs to make some coffee and have a quick breakfast of toast with avocado and tomato.

Time: 08:00
Activity: Started her design workday by responding to emails from clients and reviewing her schedule for the day.

Time: 09:30
Activity: Had a video call meeting with a new potential client to discuss their branding needs. Emilia loved brainstorming ideas on the spot!

Time: 12:00
Activity: Took a break for lunch, grabbing some tapas at a nearby café and catching up with an old friend who works there.

Time: 14:30
Activity: Continued working on a design project that was due soon. She spent a few hours researching color palettes and typography inspiration.

Time: 17:00
Activity: Stepped outside for some fresh air and a short walk around the town square with Luna. People-watching is one of her favorite pastimes!

Time: 18:30
Activity: Had dinner at home, making pasta with cherry tomatoes and basil from her garden. She's been experimenting with new recipes.

Time: 20:00
Activity: Met up with some friends for a low-key evening at their apartment. They played board games, shared stories, and had a relaxing night in.

Time: 23:00
Activity: Got home around midnight, feeling content after a wonderful day of work and socializing. Brushed her teeth again (yes, twice!), changed into PJs, and drifted off to sleep with Luna snuggled up beside her.
